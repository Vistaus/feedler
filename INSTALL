Testing && Installation
------------------------
Application cannot work without installation, because it needs schema and service.
For testing you should open terminal, go to feedler's folder and after that:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build/
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
 $ ./feedler # or just run from launcher

Have a nice day with Feedler;)
